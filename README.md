# 👋 Hi, I'm @sazzycooltehc

### **Full-Stack Developer | Modernization Enthusiast | Technical Communicator**

A developer with a passion for building scalable solutions and a keen focus on refining the way we talk about technology and development. I specialize in bridging the gap between legacy systems and modern, efficient architectural patterns.

---

### 🔭 I’m currently working on...

* **Architectural Refinement:** Exploring best practices for transitioning legacy Java-JSP applications into contemporary **Angular/Spring** full-stack ecosystems.
* **Scalability & Performance:** Building highly performant applications and optimizing backend services (Spring) to handle increased load and complexity.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning...

* The subtle art of **technical communication**, focusing on how to articulate complex **4+ years of full-stack experience** concisely and impactfully (as my recent prompt history suggests!).
* Advanced patterns in **Angular** state management and best practices for securing **Spring Boot** REST APIs.

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on...

* Open-source projects focused on **developer tooling, documentation, or profile optimization** (like README generators!).
* Any project that involves a significant **technology stack migration** or **legacy system revamp**.

### 💬 Ask me about...

* Frontend development with **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**.
* Full-stack development using **Angular** and **Spring Framework**.
* Strategies for condensing years of technical experience into a powerful profile summary.

### ⚡ Fun fact:

My favorite challenge is turning a single, vague line of experience into a paragraph that lands the interview. It's all about **prompt engineering** for your career!
